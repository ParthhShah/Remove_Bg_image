This is a Python script that removes the background from an image using the `rembg` library and saves the output with a transparent background. It utilizes the `PIL` library to handle images and save the final result in PNG format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `rembg`: A Python package for background removal.
  - `Pillow` (PIL): A Python Imaging Library (PIL Fork) for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the necessary libraries. If you don't already have them installed, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install rembg Pillow
